<h1>Spotify Profiles</h1>

Spotify Profiles is an app that lets you take a deep dive into your favorite artists. I created this for my 15-112 Term Project, a cumulative demonstration of programming methods and skills learned over the semester. During this project, I explored different ways to represent data and implementing visual design with basic graphics. This project received an A.

The entire project should be run inside the termProject folder. You can run the project within the editor from spotifyProfiles.py

You'll need the following libraries installed:
* cmu_112_graphics.py (Included in project)
* pygame
* numpy
* scikit (sklearn)
* requests 
* copy
* random


Shortcuts:
* H: show help screen
* shift + R: change color scheme (debug)
